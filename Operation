This is a gantry machine, and LinuxCNC has trouble with gantry machines.

Home in Joint (aka Free) mode, but never jog there!

Jog and run in World mode.

Use '$' to switch back and forth between Joint and World mode.


The spindle goes up to 18K rpm.

There's plenty of Onsrud tooling.



TO USE THE SHOPBOT:
- make sure cords are plugged in
- hit black button
- while the computer boots, find the collet you need for the size of bit you're using.
  insert the collet and insert the bit.  (put more here on what to do)
- turn red knob to on
- put key into spindle interlock, and make sure it's on
- when LinuxCNC launches, check e-stop
- pop out all e-stop switches
- hit e-stop button in gui (toggle it off)
- power on the machine
- home the machine.  You can only home while in JOINT mode, not WORLD mode.
- switch to WORLD mode using "$".  DO NOT JOG UNTIL YOU DO.  YOU WILL RACK THE GANTRY.
- Toggle SpindleVFD power button on.
- click "warm up spindle button" to make sure that the spindle is warm.  Takes 10 minutes, 
  and it will cycle up and then shut off.
- switch on the dust collection
- You are good to go.

- You can start the spindle manually
- Or, put the codes in.  This is safest.

WHEN YOU'RE DONE:
- power off the dust collector
- remove the bit from the spindle
- put the collet back in the place you found it and take your bit with you (unless it's a
  community bit, then leave it in the drawer you found it in.)
- remove your work piece(s) from the table
- vacuum off any debris you created, and some you didn't.  Leave it in better shape than
  when you found it.
- put the dust boot upside down so that the bristles don't get bent
- click "SpindleVFD power" button to turn off spindle VFD
- close LinuxCNC app
- Poweroff
