The spindle goes up to 18K rpm.

Initialization phase:
- make sure cords are plugged in.  There are 3 cables - the 240v, the computer 110v, the console 110v
  (and the dust collector, so really four)
- hit black button labeled "Computer power" on the silver box on the side of the shopbot.  The
  console should wake up and come out of black-screen-sleep-mode.
- Locate both e-stop pendants.  Make sure they are pushed in.  You should be in e-stop state at
  this point.
- turn red knob to on (motor power switch) and interlock key to on.
- VFD should be booting up as well, you can look to see if it's display is on.
- When system is at login prompt, login with your username and password.

- launch a terminal from the "activities" menu
   - run:
       linuxcnc ssd-shopbot/shopbot-config-1.ini
   - Alt tab to the window.  for some reason, right now, it doesn't just show up

- when LinuxCNC launches, twist the two e-stop buttons to make the system come out of e-stop

- hit e-stop button in gui (toggle it off).
- push the power button in the gui to power on the machine, you should hear it click.

- Click "home all" to home the machine.  AT THIS POINT THE MACHINE WILL MOVE.  Please
  ensure that you and all of your appendages you wish to keep are out of it's way.

- Make sure that there is no Collet Nut, no tool or collet in the spindle.  If there is,
  remove all and place aside.  Save these for the Work phase.
  
- Click "warm up spindle button" to make sure that the spindle is warm.  Takes 10 minutes, 
  and it will cycle up and then shut off.

- You are now good to start your work prep phase.

Work prep and work phase:
- find the collet you need for the size of bit you're using.
  insert the collet and insert the bit.  (put more here on what to do)
- switch on the dust collection
- You are good to go.

Post work phase:
- push in the e-stop buttons.
- remove the bit from the spindle
- put the collet back in the place you found it and take your bit with you (unless it's a
  community bit, then leave it in the drawer you found it in.)
- remove your work piece(s) from the table
- vacuum off any debris you created, and some you didn't.  Leave it in better shape than
  when you found it.
- put the dust boot upside down so that the bristles don't get bent

Shutdown Phase:
- hit all of the e-stop buttons
- power off the dust collector
- close LinuxCNC app
- Poweroff 
- Turn off the red motor power switch, and the interlock for the spindle (keyswitch)
- unplug the 240v, and the computer 110v.  You may leave the 110v for the console plugged in.
